# Super Class Geometry

Welcome to the Super Class Example

In this program I created two super classes
First: Calculate el Perimeter and Area of a Triangle 
Second: Calculate el Perimeter and Area of a Rectangle

By creating a while loop the user can repeate the process until they decided 
to quit the program. 

The Progrm will have a menu where the user can input the option 
"T" To find the area and Perimeter of a Triangle
"R" To find the area and perimeter of a Rectangle

The Main purpose of the program is to learn more about Super Classes
How we can inherit one class to another and use it.
